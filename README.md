#Large_Language_Model_(LLM)_Wrapper_from_Scratch_using_Openai_models
Creating a Large Language Model (LLM) wrapper from scratch for OpenAI models involves setting up a Python class that interacts with OpenAI's API. 
This class typically includes functions to send requests and receive responses from the models. You'll need to obtain API credentials, handle input data, and manage responses. 
It's important to consider rate limiting, costs, and error handling in your wrapper. 
The wrapper simplifies the process of using OpenAI's language models, making it easier to generate text or perform other natural language processing tasks
